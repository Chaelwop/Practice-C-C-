    <h1>Happy 18th Birthday, My Love <span class="heart">♥</span></h1>
    <p>Hello my love.</p>
    <p>Today, the world turns a little brighter, a little softer, and a lot more beautiful—because it is the day you were born. And not just any day, but your 18th birthday, a milestone of life, of blooming into the person you are destined to become. I feel so lucky to witness this moment with you.</p>
    <p>Eighteen candles cannot compare to the light you bring into my life. You are warmth when the days grow cold, my peace when the world grows loud, and the reason behind my quiet smiles. In your laughter, I find music. In your presence, I find home.</p>
    <p>As you step into adulthood, know that I will always be by your side—cheering for you, believing in you, and loving you more with each passing day. You deserve a life filled with passion, dreams that take flight, and love that never fades.</p>
    <p>Today, I celebrate you—your heart, your strength, your kindness, and the future you hold in your hands. No gift could ever measure up to the gift of you in my life. But I offer you this letter, sealed with my love and filled with wishes only meant for you.</p>
    <p>Happy 18th Birthday, my love. The best chapters of your life are just beginning—and I can’t wait to read every one with you.</p>
